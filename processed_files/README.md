Match types used in the spreadsheets in this folder:

T: True match. The title in HathiTrust identified by the matching scripts is indeed the same as the title from the book catalog.
F: False match. The title in HathiTrust identified by the matching scripts is clearly not the same as the title from the book catalog, *and* the correct title is included in HathiTrust.
M: The title from the book catalog cannot be found in HathiTrust.
U: Unclear/ambiguous. The title from the book catalog cannot positively be matched to any title, either because the entry from the book catalog is too ambiguous or because no title matching the entry can be found in WorldCat or HathiTrust.
O: OCR error.
B: Blank. The entry in the book catalog is either fully blank (the cleaning process removed all characters from that entry), or is blank of a title entry (the only content in that entry is a page number, a heading, or other non-title content that should have been removed by the cleaning process and was not).
P: Partial match. There is some sort of part-whole relationship between the title from the book catalog and the title in HathiTrust identified by the matching scripts. Typically, the entry from the book catalog is for two or more distinct works bound together in one volume, and the matching title in HathiTrust only contains one of the works, or vice versa. This also includes serials and sets where the volumes held by the library and by HathiTrust do not completely overlap.
