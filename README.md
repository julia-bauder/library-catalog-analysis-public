This repository contains replication data and code to accompany the article "HathiTrust as a Data Source for Researching Early 19th-Century Library Collections," *Information Technology and Libraries,* 2019. (insert DOI here when available)

The data covers thirteen library catalogs from ten different American libraries that were published between 1776 and 1825. Due to the terms of the licensing arrangements between HathiTrust and Google (who digitized most of the library catalogs used in this analysis), neither the PDF nor the hOCR files can be distributed in this repository. However, the PDFs can be downloaded using the Handles below. The hOCR files used in this analysis can be recreated by running the Linux pdftotext command line utility against these PDFs, using the (bbox?) flag, to extract the indicated pages.
